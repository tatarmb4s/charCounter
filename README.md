# Real-time Character Counter

For this project, I'm creating a text area with real-time character count and limit functionality using JavaScript. I want to provide a user-friendly experience for anyone filling out a form or input field by letting them know how many characters they have remaining as they type, and preventing them from typing any more characters once they've reached the limit.

I'm using JavaScript to dynamically update the total character count and remaining characters in real time, as the user types. Once they reach the character limit, I'm disabling the text area and changing the remaining character count to zero, so the user knows they've hit the limit.

## Demo

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## New Things I Learned

Learned about the addEventListener ("keyup") and how the function you specify is executed when a user releases a key on their keyboard. This can be useful for implementing keyboard shortcuts or performing live search as a user types in a search box.
